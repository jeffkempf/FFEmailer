Hello,

Sorry, but the waiver request you made in No Class Needed has been denied.

Player Dropped: Cincinnati
Player Added : Rex Burkhead

This happened for the following reason:

There was another manager with a higher waiver priority requesting the
player.

Hello,

Sorry, but the waiver request you made in No Class Needed has been denied.

Player Dropped: T.Y. Hilton
Player Added : Alex Collins

This happened for the following reason:

There was another manager with a higher waiver priority requesting the
player.
